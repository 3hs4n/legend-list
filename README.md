# Legend List 

**Legend List** is a high-performance list component for **React Native**, written purely in Javascript / Typescript (no native dependencies). It aims to be a drop-in replacement for `FlatList` and/or `FlashList` with better performance, especially when handling dynamically sized items.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Experimental ‚ö†Ô∏è 

This is an early release to test and gather feedback. It's not used in production yet and needs more work to reach parity with FlatList (and FlashList) features.

## ü§î Why Legend List?

*   **Performance:** Designed from the ground up for speed, aiming to outperform `FlatList` in common scenarios.
*   **Dynamic Item Sizes:** Natively supports items with varying heights without performance hits. Just provide an `estimatedItemSize`.
*   **Drop-in Potential:** Aims for API compatibility with `FlatList` for easier migration.
*   **Pure JS/TS:** No native module linking required, ensuring easier integration and compatibility across platforms.
*   **Lightweight:** Our goal is to keep LegendList as small of a dependency as possible. For more advanced use cases, we plan on supporting optional plugins. This ensures that we keep the package size as small as possible.

## ‚ú® Additional Features 

Beyond standard `FlatList` capabilities:

*   `maintainScrollAtEnd`: (boolean) If `true` and the user is scrolled near the bottom (within `maintainScrollAtEndThreshold * screen height`), the list automatically scrolls to the end when items are added or heights change. Ideal for chat interfaces.
*   `recycleItems`: (boolean) Toggles item component recycling.
    *   `true` (default): Reuses item components for optimal performance. Be cautious if your item components contain local state, as it might be reused unexpectedly.
    *   `false`: Creates new item components every time. Less performant but safer if items have complex internal state.

## üíª Usage

### Installation

```bash
# Using Bun
bun add @legendapp/list

# Using npm
npm install @legendapp/list

# Using Yarn
yarn add @legendapp/list
```

### Example
```ts
import React, { useRef } from "react"; 
import { View, Image, Text, StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { LegendList, LegendListRef, LegendListRenderItemProps } from "@legendapp/list";
import { userData } from "../userData"; // Assuming userData is defined elsewhere

// Define the type for your data items
interface UserData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    photoUri: string;
}

const LegendListExample = () => {

    // Optional: Ref for accessing list methods (e.g., scrollTo)
    const listRef = useRef<LegendListRef | null>(null);

    const renderItem = ({ item }: LegendListRenderItemProps<UserData>) => {

        return (
            <View style={styles.itemContainer}>
                <Image style={styles.profilePic} source={{ uri: item.photoUri }} />
                <Text style={styles.name}>{item.name}</Text>
            </View>
        );
    };

    return (
        <LegendList<UserData>
            // Required Props
            data={data}
            renderItem={renderItem} 
            estimatedItemSize={70} 

            // Strongly Recommended Prop (Improves performance)
            keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} 

            // Optional Props
            ref={listRef} 
            recycleItems={true}   
            maintainScrollAtEnd={false} 
            maintainScrollAtEndThreshold={1} 

            // See docs for all available props!
        />
    );
};

export default LegendListExample;

```
